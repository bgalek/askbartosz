# onduty

## Rationale

During your development career, you'll surely stumble upon an **on-duty** role. It's when a company asks you to be ready to intervene when something bad is happening on production servers. Depending on your character you can be intimidated by such responsibility.&#x20;

Fear not! I've gathered some tips that should help you and your team to understand what on-duty means.

### Personal confinement

If you're afraid that you would need to change your daily routine drastically, fear not!

I've been doing on duty for about 10 years now, and believe me:

* You should never make any development at late hours just because there is a problem with production. You are tired, alone and it's late - I'm sure you can easily make it worse. If it worked a few hours ago - you just need to inspect what has changed. If restarting the app will help - there is no shame with this at 2:29 a.m. If it could be an earlier deployment - simply rollback and discuss what happened tomorrow. There is really only a small % of situations where you are required to make any decisions by yourself at night.
* If the problem occurred because of one of your dependencies - i.e. another application/service - pass the incident to them! Please remember - those people are similar to you, they know their ways around their stuff and will make better decisions about their domain.
* You should not change your life because of on your duty - if you're running/cycling/whatever - just take your phone with you. Smartwatch is always helpful - for example at the swimming pool!&#x20;
* Be a friend - if you're stuck in traffic, call your teammates - maybe you won't need to open your laptop on the backseat if somebody is at home just relaxing and will help you out.
* Make screenshots, export logs, and export anything useful for tomorrow - when you can share with your team what happened. Try to find a solution that will prevent the same problem from happening again.

&#x20;Just to make it clear - your role is to **be responsive** and **report what happened tomorrow.**

### **On-duty organization**

* Always have a place with current on-duty schedules - this can be lifesaving.
* Don't rush people by calling in every 5 mins, if somebody is working on a fix - please be patient.
* Have fair, transparent on-duty rules to eliminate exploitation.
* Make sure people know that they can count on each other, and rotate on-duty roles through teams.
